# JSR-2-14Final Project: Wonderful Fruit

This is a React app that uses the FruityVice API (https://www.fruityvice.com/) to display taxonomic and nutritional information about various fruits. 

The user can click on any fruit in the list and they will see a photo, along with taxonomy and nutrition information.
